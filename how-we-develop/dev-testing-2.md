## The objective of writing test cases

Verify things working as `EXPECTED`

## The bottom line

- Verify things through output
- Be avoid to test any internal structures or workings
  - Test with mocking for non-configurations (No good, consider STUB)
  - Test the data by accessing into database or cache directly (No good, please review your interfaces)

## Simulating behaviours & Practical definition

- Stub
  - Returns the SAME result regardless of INPUTS
- Mock
  - Returns the result by selected INPUTS (maybe also the number of times it has called)
- Spy
  - Check the number of calls of certain function

## Test strategies

### Developer - Unit Test

- `When` test against the pure functions
- `Verify` the output, period
- Give you `confidence` on logics
- Tools: Jest

### Developer - Integration Test

(1)

- `When` test against the APIs
- `Verify` the output and sometimes the cache hit
- DO NOT mock ANY implementations other than configurations. if needed, DO NO WRITE
- Give you `confidence` on part of logics, database query, cache
- Tools: Jest, Supertest

(2)

- `When` test against the functions that are NOT exposed to APIs, e.g. background jobs
- `Verify` the output and sometimes the cache hit
- Be avoid to mock the implementations
- Give you `confidence` on part of logics, database query, cache
- Tools: Jest

### Functional - Smoke Test

- `When` test against the client end
- `Verify` UI display with minimized interactions
- Give you `confidence` on part of logics, part of database query, part of cache
- Tools: Playwright

### Acceptance - End-to-End Test

- `When` test against the client end
- `Verify` UI display with REAL user stories
- Give you `confidence` on part of logics, part of database query, part of cache and usability
- They are disposable tests. QA Engineers will review those regularly and decide whether we need a better ones
- Tools: Playwright
