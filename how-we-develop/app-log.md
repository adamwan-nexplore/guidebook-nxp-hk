# Application Logging <!-- omit in toc -->

## Structural logging

Each log entry should be traceable
  1. when
  2. whom
  3. what key parameters
  4. what correlation_id to find those related entries

## Searchable

Each log entry should be searchable
  - Besides the attribute `msg`, please provide some key attributes for searching / filtering.

## Log Level

Each log entry should set the log level properly
  - Help any further analysis and in case there are something abnormal

> It is fine to log something randomly for investigation but please make sure the log level is in `debug` / `verbose`

## Legal Compliance

All log entries in the cluster will sit into DataDog (Europe) due to [GDPR](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018 "https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018")

## Log Reference

Each log entry
  - should have `at least one key attributes` to match the data
  - should NOT have too many attributes (i.e. keep it `less than 10`)

> Sensitive Information like `password` and `JWT token` should be redacted

## Implementation

- [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino "https://github.com/pinojs/pino"). It is one of the most popular log libraries supporting `NestJS`
