# General

## Philosophy

1. [Boy/Girl-scout Engineer](https://www.stepsize.com/blog/how-to-be-an-effective-boy-girl-scout-engineer)

   `Always leave the code better than you found it`

   You should consider tidy up the code at the same time you submit a change.

   Like

   - extract constants
   - extract enums
   - name some complicated anonymous functions
   - leave some application logs
   - tidy up the content of application log

2. Deliver your change with quality and confidence

   `Write more pure functions and automated tests`

   - `functions` expects that inputs and outputs are always present.
   - `pure` describes a function that is no change to `non-outputs`. In JS/TS, be aware of `Promise` and `async/await`, reading current time, or generating some random stuff.
