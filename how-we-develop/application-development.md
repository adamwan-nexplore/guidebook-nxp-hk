## Data Security

- Always validate inputs (sanitization).
   - wrong interfaces can crash the app and introduce un-expected bugs
- All ids referencing need to check carefully
  - Is ID the expected type? (integer vs uuid)
  - Does ID actually exist?
  - Does ID belong to the same module?

## Interfaces

Interfaces of API are very IMPORTANT.
  - Clean
  - Un-surprised
    - Uniform interfaces
  - Focused
    - Group resources
    - Be avoid to send random fields without scoping

### Request

2. Set default values if necessary

3. Standardize the way to use `header`, `param`, `query`, and `body`

  for example:

  ```
  POST https://qualitycontrol.nexplore.com/projects/{projectId}?notifyUsers=true

  Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}

  {
      "name": "project name",
      "code": "code",
      "participants": [
        "adam",
        "benny",
        "carlos",
        ...
      ]
      ...
  }

  ```

  header = general settings on that domain, `Authorization`
  param = identifier of resource, `projectId`
  query = non-core features - `notifyUsers`
  body = persistent data

### Response

1. Categorize User ERROR correctly (4xx status code). It reduces user frictions
  - data input
  - unauthorized action
  - unauthenticated

2. Categorize System ERROR correctly (5xx status code). It could be helpful on setting alerts
  - database queries
  - connection errors
  - logic

### Style

REST is NOT necessary
  - However, we should apply some of constraints to make our API style consistent
  - If you do not know what is REST - check [here](../what-we-share/rest-api.md)

- If using REST, PUT is often simpler to implement than PATCH

## Database

- Review your database table structure, indexing, and queries carefully - check [here](database-design.md)

## Quality Assurance

- **Unit tests** are helpful - check [here](dev-testing.md)
- **Integration tests** can expose a lot of issues
- **Smoke tests** can ensure the system is working in a timely manner

## Pull Request & Code Review

- Discover something you do not know
- Audit the change of code

## Refactoring

Split logics into smaller pieces
  - Be more manageable and easier to write
