## Agenda

1. Review what tasks remain

2. Review sprint statistics
   - `BurnUp Chart`
   - `Velocity Chart`
   - `Control Chart`
   - To understand _scope change_, _velocity shift_ and _reasons why not starting some tasks_

3. Introduce, discuss and estimate the tasks

4. Note uncertain things and assign someone responsible to clarify the requirements

5. AGREE on the [sprint goal(s)](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-sprint-goal)
   - No more than three
   - Decide what should be done and what should not be done

## Story points

**We should `NOT` start any development if there are no estimation in the tasks**

Scale: `Fibonacci number` is a [good](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/why-the-fibonacci-sequence-works-well-for-estimating "https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/why-the-fibonacci-sequence-works-well-for-estimating") tool to follow

Assign the number of story points to a task by:

1. the amount of understanding
2. the effort to implement
3. the testing effort on `developers`

### Meaning of each number

Break down the tasks if the estimation is larger than 5

- 1 (very easy, can be done in less than 1 hour)
- 2 (easy, but need time to implement and verify, maybe need to spend 1 to several hours)
- 3 (medium, expected to spend around 1 day to finish it)
- 5 (complicated, expected days)

- 8 (very complicated, expected a week)

- 13 (it will be super huge that we cannot imagine, even cant estimate the timeline)

- [spike](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-spike "https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-spike")

It is possible to say the task is a `spike`, which means we do not know how to implement it

## Best Practices

Before the sprint starts:
  - Only Bugs / Tasks tickets have story points
  - Do not put tasks that exceeds the agreed capacity in any cases
