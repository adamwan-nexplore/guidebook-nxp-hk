## Problem Statement

Some teams are more critical than the other teams to affect the overall delivery schedule

```mermaid
graph LR
    infra[Infrastructure Team]
    back[Backend Teams]
    front[Frontend Teams]
    qa[QA Team]

    infra --blocks--> back
    back --blocks--> front
    back & front --blocks--> qa
```

## Unblocking Teams

- To Backend teams, API is the Final Product
- To shorten the lifecycle, we provide Mock APIs with the agreed interfaces
- Teams can work on the expected deliveries together

## Task Separation on Backend (For big tasks)

One story can split into three types of tasks

1. Mock APIs
   - new APIs added
   - make sure the interfaces are agreed
2. DB
   - how the fields changed
   - what indices added
   - what constraints applied
3. Logic
   - change of existing business logic, or replace mock implementation on mock APIs

## When to be ready?

- Before the sprint starts

## Work In Progress

- Set up the ChatOps for
  - change of database structures
  - change of API interfaces

## Challenges

- Cannot guarantee the mock interfaces the same to the final products
  - Uncertainties on wrong work
- Overlook some tasks
  - Mock APIs cannot reflect all the interactions
- Introduce more communication overhead
- Be adaptive to change
  - Maintain the same style
  - Adhere to the industrial standards
