## Objectives

- Make collaborative decisions requiring multiple stakeholders' input
- Share critical information and updates with relevant team members

## Before the meeting

### Notify early
- Announce meetings well in advance to allow proper preparation
- Late notices risk poor preparation, venue unavailability, scheduling conflicts, and reduced meeting effectiveness

### Good meeting name

- Be meaningful and clear
  - x Meeting
  - x Sharing
  - o Inspection Print Form Analysis
  - o Team Panda Express Sprint 5 Review

### Good meeting time

- Ensure the meeting does not disrupt the normal work schedule
  - x in the middle of work time (halfway through)
  - x very late in the day (overrun :()
  - o before lunchtime?
  - o after lunchtime?
  - o near the start of the day?

### Good invitation notes

- Include the meeting content
  - An agenda
  - Possible expected outcomes
  - Meeting materials (highly recommended)
    - technical illustrations are often useful

### Relevant participants

- Invite relevant people only
- Inviting people to audit is fine, but make sure they know their attendance is not mandatory

## During the meeting

- If there are more than 10 people in the room, probably it is not a meeting but an announcement
- A random, lengthy meeting is useless
- Make sure a meeting could be ended in 1 hour. Or split it into smaller sessions.
- A meeting without interactions is not a meeting
- A meeting note should be updated and visible during the meeting - It can help people to ask relevant questions and clarify the unknowns

## After the meeting

### Conclusion

- A conclusion/summary should often be sent after the meeting
- If there is no conclusion / summary, this meeting might not be necessary

### Action Plan

- Specify clearly
  - What to do
  - Who to manage who to manage
  - When to start and finish
